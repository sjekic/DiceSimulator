# DiceSimulator
## Project for Computer Architecture Class
This repository includes 2 programs:
1. DCM8 code compatible with Deeds Micro Computer Emulator
2. ASM code compatible with Arduino
The first code works with 8 LEDs and simulates the number that was rolled in a binary manner (e.g. if a 2 is pseudo-randomly generated, only the second from the right LED will light up)
The second code is compatible with Arduino and was modified accordingly - it uses 6 LEDs and represents numbers in the decimal format.
